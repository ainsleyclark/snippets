# Conditionally Serve webp Images via Nginx

--- 

## Install Brew
On the server, ensure that brew installed.

[https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux)

## Install cwebp
Then in install google cwebp, site can be found at [https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp)

```
brew install webp
```

## Convert Images
Copy ```convert-webp.sh``` to the directory you want convert the webp images too (for example: /wp-content/uploads).
Open terminal, cd to the directory and run ```sh convert-webp.sh```. If done correctly, all images within that directory (recursive) will be converted to webp with the extension of ```image.png.webp```.
You are able to adjust the quality of the webp images by adjusting the quality paramter in the sh script ```cwebp -q 80``` (0-100).

## Configure nginx

- Create the file ```/etc/nginx/conf.d/webp.conf``` and paste the following contents into it, save.

```
## Chrome/65 accept : image/webp,image/apng,image/*,*/*;q=0.8
## Firefox/58 accept: */*
## iPhone5s   accept: */*

map $http_accept $img_suffix {
  "~*webp"  ".webp";
  "~*jxr"   ".jxr";
}

## https://github.com/cdowdy/Nginx-Content-Negotiation/blob/master/nginx.conf
map $msie $cache_control {
  "1"     "private";
}

map $msie $vary_header {
  default "Accept";
  "1"     "";
}
```

- Ensure that the default nginx config file is including the webp.conf you have just created. ```nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf```. 
Under the http directive there should be something similar too ```include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;```

- Add the following to your config file under sites-available.

```
location ~* \.(?:jpg|jpeg|gif|png|ico|cur|webp|jxr)$ {
  expires 1M;
  add_header Vary $vary_header;
  add_header Cache-Control $cache_control;
  add_header Cache-Control "public";
  ## Comment to enable the access-accept.log scraper:
  access_log off;
  try_files $uri$img_suffix $uri =404;
}
```

- Reload & nginx ```sudo nginx -t && sudo service nginx reload```.

## Test

- Run with native curl user agent - should see jpg/png or original image being returned.
```
curl -I -L https://www.your-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/image.png
```

- Run with Webp accept header - should see webp being returned.
```
curl -I -L -H "accept:image/webp,image/apng,image/*,*/*;q=0.8" https://www.your-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/image.png
```
